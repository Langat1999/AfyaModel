# üöÄ Quick Start - Afya Karibu AI

Get up and running in 5 minutes!

---

## Step 1: Install Python Packages (2 minutes)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Step 2: Train the Model (30 seconds)

```bash
python train_model.py
```

**Expected output**: 
```
‚úÖ Model saved as 'afya_karibu_health_model.pkl'
```

---

## Step 3: Run the Demo (30 seconds)

### Option A: Web App (Recommended)

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Opens in browser at: http://localhost:8501

### Option B: Command Line

```bash
python predict.py
```

Interactive symptom input in terminal

### Option C: Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook afya_karibu_ml.ipynb
```

Full analysis with visualizations
