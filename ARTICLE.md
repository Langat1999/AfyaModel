# Afya Karibu AI: Bridging the Healthcare Gap in Rural Kenya Through Machine Learning

## How AI is Supporting UN SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being)

### üåç The Problem: Healthcare Accessibility in Rural Kenya

Imagine living in a rural village in Kenya, hours away from the nearest hospital. You wake up with a fever, persistent cough, and difficulty breathing. Is it a common cold, or something more serious? Should you make the expensive, time-consuming journey to a health facility, or wait and see?

This dilemma faces millions of Kenyans every day. According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, **over 60% of rural populations lack timely access to quality healthcare services**. Language barriers, limited digital health tools, and delayed interventions compound the problem, leading to preventable health complications and deaths.

This is exactly the problem that **Afya Karibu AI** aims to solve.

### üí° The Solution: AI-Powered Health Urgency Prediction

**Afya Karibu** (Swahili for "Welcome to Health") is an artificial intelligence system that predicts health urgency levels based on patient symptoms and demographic profiles. Built using supervised machine learning, the system helps individuals and healthcare workers make informed decisions about when medical attention is truly urgent.

#### How It Works:

1. **Symptom Input**: Users enter their symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulty)
2. **Patient Profile**: Basic health information (age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol)
3. **AI Prediction**: Machine learning model analyzes patterns and predicts urgency
4. **Actionable Guidance**: Clear recommendations on next steps

The entire process takes less than a second and works in both **English and Swahili**, making it accessible to the target demographic.

### ü§ñ The Technology: Supervised Machine Learning

Afya Karibu uses **supervised learning**, a type of AI where the model learns from labeled examples (past patient data) to make predictions about new cases.

#### Our Approach:

**Dataset**: 349 patient records with symptoms, demographics, and health outcomes  
**Features**: 8 input variables (symptoms + patient profile)  
**Target**: Binary classification (High Risk vs. Low Risk)  
**Algorithms Tested**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression  
**Best Model**: Random Forest Classifier  

#### Performance Metrics:

- ‚úÖ **Accuracy**: 92% ‚Äî correctly predicts 92 out of 100 cases
- ‚úÖ **AUC Score**: 0.94 ‚Äî excellent ability to distinguish between risk levels
- ‚úÖ **Recall**: 94% ‚Äî catches 94% of urgent cases (critical for health!)
- ‚úÖ **Processing Time**: <1 second per prediction

These metrics demonstrate that machine learning can be a reliable tool for health risk assessment, especially when professional medical care is not immediately available.

### üéØ Addressing UN SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being

The United Nations' **Sustainable Development Goal 3** aims to "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages." Specifically, Target 3.8 focuses on achieving **universal health coverage** (UHC), including access to quality essential healthcare services.

#### How Afya Karibu Contributes to SDG 3:

**1. Increased Access to Health Information**
- Provides instant health risk assessment without requiring a doctor visit
- Available 24/7, even in remote areas with internet/mobile connectivity
- Free and accessible to all, regardless of economic status

**2. Early Detection and Prevention**
- Identifies urgent cases early, enabling timely intervention
- Reduces complications from delayed treatment
- Promotes preventive care and health awareness

**3. Reduced Healthcare Disparities**
- Bilingual support (English/Swahili) breaks language barriers
- Accessible via smartphone, no specialized equipment needed
- Empowers rural communities with health knowledge

**4. Efficient Resource Allocation**
- Helps prioritize urgent cases for limited healthcare resources
- Reduces unnecessary hospital visits for low-risk cases
- Supports healthcare workers with decision-making tools

**5. Health Literacy and Empowerment**
- Educates users about symptoms and health risks
- Builds trust in data-driven health assessment
- Encourages informed healthcare decisions

### üõ†Ô∏è Building the Solution: The ML Journey

#### Step 1: Data Exploration

We started with a health dataset containing patient symptoms, demographics, and outcomes. Exploratory data analysis revealed:

- Balanced dataset: 53% positive (high risk), 47% negative (low risk)
- Most common symptoms: Fever (50%), Cough (52%), Fatigue (48%)
- Age range: 19-87 years, average age 35
- Strong correlation between multiple symptoms and urgent outcomes

#### Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Machine learning models require numerical data, so we:

- Encoded binary symptoms (Yes=1, No=0)
- Label-encoded categorical variables (Gender, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol)
- Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler
- Split data: 80% training, 20% testing

#### Step 3: Model Training

We trained three different algorithms:

| Model | Accuracy | AUC | Training Time |
|-------|----------|-----|---------------|
| Random Forest | 92% | 0.94 | 2.3s |
| Gradient Boosting | 90% | 0.92 | 3.1s |
| Logistic Regression | 85% | 0.88 | 0.8s |

**Random Forest** emerged as the winner due to superior performance and interpretability.

#### Step 4: Model Evaluation

We used multiple metrics to ensure reliability:

- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualized true/false positives/negatives
- **ROC Curve**: Demonstrated excellent discrimination ability
- **Feature Importance**: Identified which symptoms matter most
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensured model generalizes to new data

#### Step 5: Deployment

We built an interactive web application using **Streamlit**, featuring:

- User-friendly bilingual interface
- Real-time predictions with confidence scores
- Visual risk gauges and probability charts
- Actionable recommendations in English and Swahili

### ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Considerations: Responsible AI for Health

Building AI for healthcare comes with significant ethical responsibilities. We addressed several key concerns:

#### 1. Bias and Fairness

**Risk**: Dataset may not represent rural Kenyan populations equally.

**Mitigation**:
- Continuous data collection from diverse sources
- Regular fairness audits across demographics
- Community validation with local healthcare workers

#### 2. Privacy and Data Protection

**Risk**: Sensitive health data could be misused.

**Mitigation**:
- No personally identifiable information stored
- Local processing (no cloud transmission)
- Transparent data usage policies
- GDPR-compliant design

#### 3. Over-Reliance on AI

**Risk**: Users may trust AI over professional medical advice.

**Mitigation**:
- Clear disclaimers: "This is a support tool, not a replacement for doctors"
- Always recommend professional consultation for serious cases
- Human-in-the-loop design for healthcare worker validation

#### 4. Accessibility

**Risk**: Digital divide may exclude most vulnerable populations.

**Mitigation**:
- Mobile-first design (works on basic smartphones)
- Offline capability (future enhancement)
- Partnership with community health workers
- Solar-powered device support
